I believe you got this book because you are one of those brave souls willing to take the journey and learn programming. I am very impressed. Given enough time, you will soon have the power many people won't have. That power will help you improve or *"destroy"* the world. But I hope that you wield this soon-to-be-learned power for the greater good. (No hacking accounts just to stalk on your crush or on someone, *okay?* That's creepy and violates their privacy.)    
Programming is one heck of an adventure. It has its joys, sorrows, problems, and miracles. It may be intimidating at first, but with enough perseverance, you will learn. And before you know it, you're already developing software that millions of people use. *Please don't forget me when you're rich!*    
    
I decided to learn programming, not for profit nor for a school requirement, but for the joy of doing it. That brings in the positive side effect of impressing your friends. Over time, I unconsciously shifted my efforts in programming to help solve problems. And that's the very essence of programming, the reason why it exists - to solve problems. I won't be able to write this book without programming. You won't be able to use your computer (you do have or have used one, right?) without programming. And Neil Armstrong wouldn't be able to fly to the moon, and walk on that big chunk of rock, without programming. But here I tell you when you start to learn programming. Don't learn it within a few months (or even weeks, or worse, days!) just to be able to get that programming job in your favorite company, brag to your friends and/or impress them, or just for the heck of learning programming. After all, programming is not about gaining bragging rights just to say that you know how to program computers. And don't learn programming within a short time span. It's not gonna work! It's like creating art. You won't be able create a highly detailed reconstruction of the Notre Dame when you're just starting out. Let time take its place. Learn programming for the fun of doing it and with a burning passion. Don't worry about solving problems. You'll be solving them when the time is right. But right now, learn to program with passion. Never be discouraged by negative feedback from other people. As long as you have the will and ambition to learn programming, you'll be able to program computers.    
    
*Young padawan*, take your first step now. Be confident and fearless. Don't fear the problems that will arise while learning. The joke above will let you know what you'll encounter during your journey as a programmer. You may not know what it means now, but, hopefully, you will get it when the time comes (when you finally get the meaning of the joke above, please don't hesitate to tweet or contact me to let me know of the update. I'll appreciate the effort and it'll let me know that someone is reading my book).    
    
Now, take your leap of faith. Never fear the uncertainties of the process of becoming a *Jedi Master* (I mean, master programmer). Mistakes will naturally be made. Treat those mistakes as lessons to improve your skills (or talent) in programming.    
    
Good luck, programmer! May the force be with you.    
    
All the best,
